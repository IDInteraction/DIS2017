TODO: Write up fully

Requirements (that are unlikely to be installed by default):
* Functioning LaTeX system, with texlive-fonts-extra package installed
* R, including tidyverse.
[ Tidyverse requires the following packages, that may not be installed by
default: libcurl4-openssl-dev, libssl, libxml2-dev ]

* Python 2.7.  Will need to:

pip install sklearn (used 0.18.1)
(NumPy (used 1.11.0), SciPy (used 0.18.1), Pandas (used 0.17.1)  and OpenCV (I
used 2.4.9.1) are also required. If installing OpenCV with pip the package is opencv-python)

Clone repository & submodules from github:
git clone https://github.com/IDInteraction/DIS2017.git
git submodule init
git submodule update

(If you are not using public key authentication for gitihub you may need to edit
.gitmodules and change the url of the submodule to
https://github.com/IDInteraction/abc-display-tool.git, before running
git submodule sync
git submodule init
git submodule update)


Copy attention data from Attention/
Copy tracking data from Tracking/
Copy transition annotations from spot_the_difference submodule to Attention:
cp spot_the_difference/controlfiles/transitionAnnotations.csv ./Attention/


[ To generate tracking from the source videos, copy all the videos
to video/, and the Attention folder to Attention/   Install the IDInteraction
tracking-tools to give access to the required scripts and Docker images.

If using the original
bounding boxes copy InitialBoundingBoxes/ from Dropbox to the
InitialBoundingBoxes/.  (If specifying new bounding boxes edit the
./generateTracking.sh script where indicated).  

Run ./generateTracking.sh  This will run cppMT on each part of the video, and
Openface on the whole video, and copy/compress these in the appropriate
places. If new bounding boxes are required these will be prompted for at the
start of the process. All the tracking happens after we have a bounding box
for each participant and experiment part; this will take many hours to run. ]


Encode attentions: ./encodeAttentions.sh

Load the project in R Studio
Open IDInteraction_DIS.Rnw
Hit "compile PDF"
Wait a while; takes >30 mins to run tracker for all combinations specified in
the paper.   
Runlog.txt will log progress

You may find that you need to remove the cache folder if you have problems
compiling the document in RStudio.
